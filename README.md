This is a timer application that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS. It allows you to set the number of seconds to complete one set. Once the time counts down to 0, the app resets to the amount of seconds set, and adds one set to the set count. The standard goal is to perform 10 sets. Overall, I learned a lot about using EJS and the Hyper Terminal in building this application.

I have also included an about section using EJS with a description of the workout, as well as an embedded video of David Goggins himself talking about it while performing Nickels and Dimes.
